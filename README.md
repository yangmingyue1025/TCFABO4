In this work, we proposed a machine learning framework to predict the τf values of ABO4-type ceramics. Leveraging a dataset of 125 experimentally reported materials, a rigorous feature screening strategy integrating redundancy reduction with multiple feature selection methods was employed to identify a physically meaningful descriptor set. Molecular dielectric polarizability (pm), bond valence sum (bvs), degree of covalence (cvd), and space group (sp) were identified as the dominant factors governing the τf value. Notably, pm plays the most crucial role in influencing the τf value through the ion polarizability dilution theory. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model exhibited the best predictive performance on the testing set. The established model was further applied to the Materials Project database for high-throughput screening, revealing quantitative descriptor windows associated with near-zero τf. These insights provide practical guidance for the rational design of thermally stable MWDCs.
